# Use Cases

Cosolvent focuses on “thin” markets where discovery and matching are difficult due to sparse supply/demand, specialization, or fragmentation. Examples include:

- Niche B2B marketplaces: specialized manufacturing capabilities, lab services, or compliance auditors.
- Talent-to-project matching: domain-expert freelancers to highly specific project briefs.
- Research/data exchanges: datasets, annotations, and licensing terms across small communities.
- Local producer networks: farmers, co-ops, and small distributors aggregating to form a thick market.

How Cosolvent helps:
- Normalizes participant and asset profiles into consistent models.
- Enriches items with industry context and metadata (LLM-assisted) to increase match quality.
- Provides search and job pipelines to surface relevant matches quickly.

Adopt the provided schemas and services, extend where needed, and integrate your custom ranking/scoring to fit vertical needs.
